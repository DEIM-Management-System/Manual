# How to have an Interactive Presentation at DEIM forum

## Regarding the new implementation of interactive presentation in DEIM 2022
* Since DEIM 2022 adopted online style  completely due to Covid-19 problem, the intaractive sessions will be held online.
* [oVice](https://ovice.in/) is used for intaractive sessions.
* Each presenter needs to prepare the following materials.
   1. **The abstract of the study (1 page poster in PDF format, pre-submit is required)**
      * Create in 16:9 horizontal size in PowerPoint, etc.
      * This poster is put at your poster booth in the oVice venue.
   2. **The slides for your intaractive presentation**
      * You can reuse the above one-page poster, or can use other material such as PowerPoint slides (multiple pages are allowed).
      * Recommend 16:9 horizontal size 

## Procedures of an interactive presentation
1. Regarding access to oVice
    * **Make sure to use "Google Chrome browser" for accessing oVice.**
    * When you first access to the oVice space, inputting your name is requested. Input your name as like **"day2-p11:name_affiliation"**.
    	* To change your name after once inputted, click your icon on the oVice screen to open the window of settings.
    * When entering each floor of oVice DEIM venue, oVice requires the allowance to use microphone and camera. Click "allow".
    * It’s a good idea to have a practice how to use the oVice venue before the real session. The oVice venue is ready by the morning of each session day.
        * Further, the oVice venue has already been ready. You can make a practice there. Access your session on [DEIM 2022 program](https://cms.dbsj.org/deim2022/program/), and click the "発表会場" button to enter.
2. **By 10 minutes before the starting time**, find your session in [DEIM 2022 program](https://cms.dbsj.org/deim2022/program/) and click "発表会場" button  to enter the oVice venue for your intaractive presentation.
    * When we have some technical issues of the oVice venue, we show an emergency announcement at the top of [DEIM portal](https://cms.dbsj.org/deim2022/program/).
    * **If you have any difficulty to have your presentation on the day (before entering the oVice venue), please email to "deim2022-inquiry@googlegroups.com"．**
3. In the oVice venue, a dedicated poster booth is allocated for each presenter. Move to your booth to wait.
    * Confirm that your pre-submitted one page poster is put at the booth.
    * If the poster is not yours, please notify to the session chair or organizers.
4. Click the inside of the cubicle at the booth to enter into the "oVice meeting room".
    * The functionality of "meeting room" in oVice isolates the inside of the room from the outside. Your conversation doesn't go out, and outside conversation doesn't come in.
    * Further, a shared screen is effective to the people inside the meeting room.
    * **To leave from an oVice meeting room, click the following button at the bottom of the oVice screen.**

5. **By 5 minutes before the starting time**, the session chair of the session enters into the oVice venue, and check whether all the presenters are there or not.
7. The session chair or organizers start the session. Now, you can enjoy presenting your study to audiences and the discussion with them as a physical poster presentation.
8. Regarding vote ("Like" button)
    * There is a button to "Like" links. You can promote it to audiences after your presentation.	
        * ![Image of the Like button](img/oVice_like_button.png) When an audience click it, a new tab or window opens in your browser to show the links of "Like" and "much Like".
    * **Note, this vote determines the Best Interactive Award and the Excellent Interactive Awards.**
    	* The vote from the same affiliation with you is uncounted.
    	* Multiple click from the same audience is uncounted.
    	* For the presentations nominated as award candidates, the details of the votes will be strictly checked.
16. At the time of ending the session, an organizer announces the end of the session. 
    * You can leave from the oVice venue by closing the browser tab or window.
    * The oVice venue is available through the DEIM forum period, enjoy discussion or chatting with other audiences.
17. After presentation, you may receive questions about your study on the bulletin board for each session. Try to reply them.
