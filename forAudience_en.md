# How to join DEIM sessions as an audience

[<<Home](README.md)

## 【IMPORTANT】Regarding the new oral presentation style in DEIM 2022
* In DEIM 2022, we don't have Q and A time after each presentation in Cisco Webex. Instead, however, after all presentations in a session done there, all presenters and attendees move to oVice and together have Q and A time there. The Q and A venue in oVice and its processes are the same as those of the online poster presentation.
* The structure of each session (125 minutes or 150 minutes)
	* **1st half: oral presentations in Webex**：15 minutes for each presentation * 4 - 6 presentations (totally 60 - 90 minutes)
	* **2nd half：Q and A in oVice**: The remaining time of the session

##  Procedures to attend an oral presentation session
1. **By 10 minutes before the starting time**, the meeting room for each session becomes ready to enter.
2. Access to [DEIM 2022 program](https://cms.dbsj.org/deim2022/program/) until 10 minutes before the starting time, click the "発表会場" button of the research session you want to attend in order to enter its [Webex](https://mediafiles.webex.com/ja/downloads.html) meeting room.
    * When you firstly use Webex, the input of your name is required. Input your name as **"name_affiliation"** to show that you are a presenter.
        * To change the name after once inputted it, you need to leave from a Webex meeting. See the bottom Tips section for further details.
    * When we have some technical issues of the Webex meeting room, we show an emergency announcement at the top of [DEIM portal](https://cms.dbsj.org/deim2022/program/). There is a chance that we use a backup meeting room when the original meeting room has a trouble. In that case, the URL of the meeting room can be changed.
3. Note, we don't have Q and A time in the presentations at Webex meeting room as mentioned above.
    * After all presentations have been given in each session, a Q & A time will be held at the oVice venue.
4. When all presentations finish, follow the guides from the session chair and organizers to move to the Q and A space in the oVice venue.
    * The URL of the oVice space will be provided in the chat space of the Webex meeting. Click it.
    * **Make sure to use "Google Chrome browser" for accessing oVice.**
    * You also can access to the Q and A space in the oVice venue by opening [DEIM2022 program](https://cms.dbsj.org/deim2022/program/) and clicking the "質疑会場" button of your session.

    * When entering each floor of oVice DEIM venue, oVice requires the allowance to use microphone and camera. Click "allow".
    * It’s a good idea to have a practice how to use the oVice venue before the real session.

5. Enjoy discussions with presenters.

    * You can quickly start asking questions to the presenters if they are ready.
6. To ask a question, you need to click the inside of the cubicle of each booth to enter into the "oVice meeting room".
    * The functionality of "meeting room" in oVice isolates the inside of the room from the outside. Your conversation doesn't go out, and outside conversation doesn't come in.
    * Further, a shared screen is effective to the people inside the meeting room.
    * **To leave from an oVice meeting room, click the following button at the bottom of the oVice screen.**
